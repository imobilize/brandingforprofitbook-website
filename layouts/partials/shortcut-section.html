        <h3>Branding For Profit is a <span>Shortcut</span></h3>
        <p class="introdetails">
          Before we created the Branding For Profit framework – we were working with hundreds of clients helping them to
          launch their startups. As a digital agency, we excelled at creating products such a Mobile Apps, and Saas
          (Software As A Service) applications.<br /><br />

          As I'm sure you are aware, the failure rate for startups is high.
          After their product launch, a lot of our clients seemed to struggle to get customers. This meant we lost
          clients fast.<br><br>

          <strong><em>So we decided to find a better way for them to launch.</em></strong><br><br>

          We started building our own digital products as case studies. We wanted to learn all aspects of marketing
          necessary to successfully launch a profitable Startup.<br /><br />

          After many years of hard work, plus lots of trial and error, we had spent over $300,000 testing what works.
          Although the marketing strategy was slightly different based on the industry we launched in, we noticed one
          common trait amongst everything successful that we did.
          We then looked back at all the companies we had worked with, and analyzed the industry as a whole. A clear
          pattern emerged.
          <br /><br />
          <b>All the companies that crushed it on their launches had an <u>Amazing Brand</u></b>
          <br /><br />

          The evidence was conclusive beyond a shadow of doubt. This one single factor accounted for most of a companies
          profitability.
          <br /><br />

          See below for an article snippit that shows the importance of a brand when trying to get customers:
          <br /><br />

        <h4>Why Startups Create Terrible Brands</h4>
        <br />

        <p class="introdetails pb-5">
          The problem is, a lot of Startups underestimate the importance of a Brand. Most of them don't realise the
          simple mistakes that they are making when putting one together. These mistakes cost them dearly in lack of
          customers and lack of revenue. It ultimately causes their Startups to fail.
          <br />
          <br />
          The good news is these mistakes are easy to fix if you know what you are doing. And they are just as easy to
          learn and apply. It doesn't require a ton of money to be spent designing a logo. And it doesn't require any
          highly paid expertise. It simply requires you to follow a few simple principles.
          <br />
          <br />
          <mark><b>The Branding For Profit framework includes the most important aspects that need to be considered when creating
          a highly profitable brand.</b></mark>
          <br />
          <b>We wanted a simple fast repeatable process that we could take our clients through before we developed their
          digital solutions.</b>
          <br /><br />
          For some of the brands created with the framework, clients were getting offers for investment <b>even before
            they had sold a single product.</b>
          Whereas most entrepreneurs have to pitch their idea to hundreds of investors in order to raise capital, the
          Branding For Profit approach made it easy to get funding. <u>Their brands were perceived with high value way
            before they had actual customers.</u>
          <br />
          <br />
          Now for the very first time, you can have access to this same framework, broken down into an easy to read
          guide. Save yourself the time and money we went spent trying to find what works. Branding For Profit is a
          shortcut to creating an amazing brand in the quickest time possible.
