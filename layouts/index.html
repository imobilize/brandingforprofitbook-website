          <h2>What Is <span>Branding For Profit</span>?</h2>
          <p class="introdetails">
            Branding For Profit is <b><u>a counterintuitive approach</u></b> to creating a highly profitable
            brand.<br><br>

            <em>We create brand assets at a very low cost. Then using tactics based on human psychology, we create a
              reputation for the brand that is highly perceived in the market place.
            </em><b>Customers become instant buyers.</b><br><br>

            This is done through the Branding For Profit framework which uses an easy to follow step by step approach.
            The approach leverages techniques employed by successful startup companies that turned
            their brands into multi-million dollar profit generating machines.

        <h3 >Branding For Profit is a <span>Shortcut</span></h3>
        <p class="introdetails">
          Before we created the Branding For Profit framework – we were working with hundreds of clients helping them to
          launch their startups. As a digital agency, we excelled at creating products such a Mobile Apps, and Saas (Software As A Service) applications.<br /><br />
          
          As I'm sure you are aware, the failure rate for startups is high.
          After their product launch, a lot of our clients seemed to struggle to get customers. This meant we lost clients fast.<br><br>

          <strong><em>So we decided to find a better way for them to launch.</em></strong><br><br>

          We started building our own digital products as case studies. We wanted to learn all aspects of marketing necessary to successfully launch a profitable Startup.<br /><br />
          
          After many years of hard work, plus lots of trial and error, we had spent over $300,000 testing what works. Although the marketing strategy was slightly different based on the industry we launched in, we noticed one common trait amongst everything successful that we did.
          We then looked back at all the companies we had worked with, and analyzed the industry as a whole. A clear pattern emerged.
          <br /><br />
          <b>All the companies that crushed it on their launches had an <u>Amazing Brand</u></b>
          <br /><br />

          The evidence was conclusive beyond a shadow of doubt. This one single factor accounted for most of a companies profitability. 
          <br /><br />

          See below for some info graphics that show the importance of a brand when trying to get customers:
          <br /><br />
        </p>
        <h4>How Brands Persuade Consumers To Buy</h4>
        <br />
        <img class="ACModelvsoldmodelDiagram " alt="Product Discovery"
          src="/images/product-discovery.jpg">
          
        <br /><br />
        <h4>How Brands Have An Influential Voice</h4>
        <br />
        <img class="ACModelvsoldmodelDiagram " alt="Product Discovery"
          src="/images/brands-are-followed.jpg">

        <p class="introdetails pb-5">
          The problem is, a lot of Startups underestimate the importance of a Brand. Most of them don't realise the simple mistakes that they are making when putting one together. These mistakes cost them dearly in lack of customers and lack of revenue. It ultimately causes their Startups to fail.
          <br />
          <br />
          The good news is these mistakes are easy to fix if you know what you are doing. And they are just as easy to learn and apply. It doesn't require a ton of money to be spent designing a logo. And it doesn't require any highly paid expertise. It simply requires you to follow a few simple principles.

          The Branding For Profit framework includes the most important aspects that need to be considered when creating a highly profitable brand.

          We wanted a simple fast repeatable process that we could take our clients through before we developed their digital solutions.
          <br /><br />
          For some of the brands created with the framework, clients were getting offers for investment <b>even before they had sold a single product.</b>
          Whereas most entrepreneurs have to pitch their idea to hundreds of investors in order to raise capital, the Branding For Profit model made it easy to get funding. <u>Their brands were perceived with high value way before they had actual customers.</u>
          <br />
          <br />
          Now for the very first time, you can have access to this same framework, broken down into an easy to read guide. Save yourself the time and money we went spent trying to find what works. Branding For Profit is a shortcut to creating an amazing brand in the quickest time possible.

        <p>Along The Way I Had To Ignore Conventional Wisdom, Break All The Rules, And Do Something Completely Different To Find A Successful Way To Launch 
          – Read The Story Below To Discover What Happened…</p>

        <h3 class="pb-3">This Personal Experience Changed Everything</h3>
        <p class="center-subtitle">Let me share my personal story with you. Before Branding For Profit was developed, I
          failed miserably as an
          entrepreneur.</p>
        <p>I had never been taught business at school and was never really that interested in making money. I just
          wanted to work on cool software projects that were interesting.

        <p>I was, however, inspired by some of the famous software developers such as Bill Gates and Elon Musk that
          had created something the world wanted and used.</p>
          <br />
        <p>So I set out to build something I thought the world needed. An events platform that would change how we
          discover and engage with up-coming events. Think of Eventbrite crossed with Instagram and you will be close
          to what I had in mind.</p>
          <br />
        <p>You can see some screenshots of the app below. For no other reason than I thought it was a cool name, I
          called the website and app Onit. To this day I still cringe even just saying the name ...</p>

        <p>I wasn't alone in this endeavor. I hired some inexperienced software developers and personally mentored and
          trained them. In doing so I discovered I had a real talent for teaching and making things easy to understand.
          They eventually became great software engineers.</p>

        <h3 class="pb-3">My First Major Product Launch Was A Disaster!</h3>
        <p>The sofware worked well. Both website and app had a great user interface, nicely designed and was simple to
          use. Being one of the best software developers in the UK I expected nothing less.</p>
          
          <br />
          <p><b>The problem was, no one
            wanted to use it!</b></p>
        <p>I had made three of the biggest mistakes a Startup could make.
          <li>Firstly I had designed and developed something for myself assuming that lots of other people would want it
            too. </li>
          <li>Secondly I had not tested the market to see if there was a demand.</li>
          <li>Third, I knew nothing about marketing.</li>

        </p>
        <br />
        <p>I had spent so much time focusing on becoming the best software engineer I could that it never occured to me
          that I needed to learn anything about marketing.</p>
        <p>I had the "if you build it they will come" mentality. If I ever find the person that made me believe this
          nonsense I will beat him to a pulp!</p>
          <br />
        <p>Up until now <b>I had spent over $150,000 dollars on developing this software!</b> Most of this money was
          spent on paying employees but I had also been renting office space, buying computer and office equipment,
          paying utility bills, paying accountancy fees and even local area office tax.</p>
        <p>With no one using the app or website there was literally no way to recoup this money!</p>

        <p>Perseverance being one of my personality traits I wasn't giving up that easily.</p>
        <p>I believed if I could just market the app people would want to use it for sure. So I devised all sorts of
          clever marketing tactics to build brand awareness and get people to download it.

        <p>Below you will see some of my marketing ideas:</p>

        <p>One product is a fitness app called <b>Fit In 5</b> that myself and my business partner Marvin launched
          together. It gives you fitness exercises in bitesize 5 min routines so that even if you are limited on time,
          you can still get a workout.

        <h3 class="pb-3">Why Was This App Launch Different?</h3>
        <p>The launch was different because I had stumbled upon the secret of what makes a good Brand. Call it dumb luck or an act of God if you want. But this is how I came across it...</p>
        <br />
        <p>While on holiday I struck up a random conversation with a complete stranger by the pool side bar. Turns out this guy was very rich. He had ran several businesses, sold them and was now retired. Being in business too I decided to share with him some of the stuff I was doing.
          Maybe he could offer me some advice I thought.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
          After I finished explaining my previous failures to him, he smiled, turned to me and uttered a few simple words that I will never forget...
          <b>"The problem is you don't understand humans" he said. Read some books on human psychology.</b></p>
          <br />
          <p>I felt insulted. Here I was pouring my heart out to this complete stranger and all he could say was that I didn't understand humans! Why would I want to understand humans I thought. They are irrational and illogical. I worked with computers because code made a lot more sense. I never spoke to the guy again after that.</p>
          <br />
          <p>When I got back from holiday I was staring at some code late at night. For a break I started to browse the web. Reading some articles on marketing I came across one that talked about the connection between marketing and human behaviour. Interesting I thought... maybe there was something to what the stranger on holiday had said.</p>
            <br />
          <p>Due to my ignorance, I had treated the stranger badly. Little did I know that he had steered me in the direction of uncovering some of the most powerful secrets to a successful company. To this day I feel terrible for not even knowing his name.</p>

        <h3 class="pb-3">What Was The Result?</h3>
        <p>After consuming many books on the topic of human behaviour, books on advertising, and books on marketing, it became very clear what I needed to do.</p>
        <p>We had to convince consumers we were trustworthy, highly valuable, and that we could satisfy a particular desire they had.</p>

        <p><b>The best way to do this is with an amazing Brand.</b></p>
        <br />
      <p>Before even doing a proper launch of the fitness app, we had used some of the powerful branding techniques that I had started to develop. (The same techniques are shared with you in the Branding For Profit book). It led to a huge contract with a UK television network. <b>The best part was, we didn't yet have a single customer!!!</b></p>
    <br />
    <p>We got exposure most Startups dream of before the product was fully ready. We were in such a rush to get it out we hadn't built the app to sustain a large volume of users. The service went down for several hours under the load while we frantically tried to fix it.</b></p>
<p>It was the experience of launching this App where I first learnt how to fully utilize the power of Branding. </p>

        <h3>What is Ascension Framework?</h3>
        <p>The Ascension Framework is a solution to the common problem of not being able to generate customers on
          demand. We are able to generate hundreds of new customers everyday by selling high-value low-dollar products
          (such as the one on this page) through advertising. <br><br>

          We instantly recuperate our advertising expenses but end up with a customer who now knows who we are and

          $50 advertising budget.</p>

        <h3 class="headings">Your Purchase Is Backed By Our<br>Unconditional Money Back Guarantee</h3>
        <h4>I know that before I get into anything… I’d like to know what I’m buying and that it’s backed by a solid
          money-back guarantee.<br><br>

          <strong><em>And I want you to be comfortable with this purchase.</em></strong><br><br>

          And even though it’s only $9.00 – you worked for that money and it counts.<br><br>

          Like my grandpa used to say “Test drive the car before you drive it off the lot”…<br><br>

          So here’s what I’ve arranged:<br><br>

          Download the eBook, read it, but more importantly apply what you learn in there.<br><br>

          And if you’re not blown away by what you learn.<br><br>

          Then just shoot us an email at admin@imobilize.co.uk and request a refund within 30 days.<br><br>

          We’ll refund you your $9.00 and let you keep the Branding For Profit book free of charge.<br><br>

          How’s that for a money back guarantee? I’d say pretty good!
